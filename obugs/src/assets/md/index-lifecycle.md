With oBugs, we follow a simple cycle: everyone can report an issue, then the community discuss them and propose some patches on them, finally moderators and administratos accept or decline them.

- **Reporting**: If your application is on oBugs, go to the dedicated page and start reporting. Users can submit bug reports, highlighting the issues they encounter in software applications. Provide the most information possible, either with pictures, videos or more. You can navigate the bug database to see if the bug has already been reported and provide more information.

- **Community Contribution**: The community can contribute by adding comments, or suggesting patches on entries. This collaborative effort enriches bug descriptions and help curate the bug database.

- **Voting**: Users can vote on entries, helping to prioritize which ones are the most critical or widespread. Users can also give feedback on patch suggestion, so that moderators and administrators can take the best decision.
